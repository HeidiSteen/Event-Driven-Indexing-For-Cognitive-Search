        "*":"The Tabernas Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Tabernas) is one of Spain's semi-arid deserts, located within Spain's south-eastern province of Almeria. It is in the interior, about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of the provincial capital Almeria, in the Tabernas municipality in Andalusia. Due to its high elevation and inland location, it has slightly higher annual rainfall (more than 20 cm (7.9 in) per year) and lower annual average temperature than coastal areas of Almeria. A nature reserve (protected area), it spans 280 square kilometers (110 square miles)."
